# cordova-geolocation

An element providing geolocation for cordova applications.


## Dependencies

Element dependencies are managed via [Bower](http://bower.io/). You can
install that via:

    npm install -g bower

Then, go ahead and download the element's dependencies:

    bower install


## Playing With Your Element

If you wish to work on your element in isolation, we recommend that you use
[Polyserve](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/polyserve) to keep your element's
bower dependencies in line. You can install it via:

    npm install -g polyserve

And you can run it via:

    polyserve

Once running, you can preview your element at
`http://localhost:8080/components/cordova-geolocation/`, where `cordova-geolocation` is the name of the directory containing it.


## Yeoman support

If you'd like to use Yeoman to scaffold your element that's possible. The official [`generator-polymer`](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-polymer) generator has a [`seed`](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-polymer#seed) subgenerator.
